Welcome to my first Windows Forms C# Project!

I enjoyed this project because I was able to practice OOP principles and continue practicing C#.
I have recognized opportunities for and look forward to code refactoring where repeated blocks occur in this program.  

** A special thanks to my wife for supporting UAT efforts **

Have fun!
