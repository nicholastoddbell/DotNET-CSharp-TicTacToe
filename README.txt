Welcome to my first Windows Forms C# Project!

I enjoyed this project because I was able to practice OOP principles and continue practicing C#.
I have recognized opportunities for and look forward to performing code refactoring where repeated blocks occur in this program.  

** A special thanks to my wife for supporting UAT efforts **

How to run: Visit my GitHubPage at https://nicholastoddbell.github.io/DotNET-CSharp-TicTacToe/publish.htm. Select launch > open > install > (sometimes) run and then have fun playing Tic-Tac-Toe with a friend using the mouse to click on the gameboard location you would like to claim.

Have fun!
